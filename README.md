## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not have to use any outside resources, Codepath's guide was more than helpful to get me throught the project. I did however use GeeksForGeeks for some reference in further understading syntax etc.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Understadning basic HTML terminology such as tags and how classes work was challenging at first but became self explanatory as I continued in the project.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- How can I use css to modernise my web applications further?
- How can I add pages to my web app?

After completing this project a question which stuck out to me the most was, whether there is a more efficient way to create web applications rather than coding in 3 different languages CSS, HTML and JS. I understand how each language has its own important role to play within the webapp. However, there must be a more efficient way? After completing this submission I began researching Node.js, React, etc to learn if there does exist a method that can simplify the process.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

While developing this project I wanted to make cool animations and better color correlations when I pressed on the buttons. The only issue was the amount of workload I had from classes and extra curriculars which held me back from actually creating an awesome version of this web app. There are so many things I will work on and use glitch to create after submitting my project to further develop my skills. For starters implementing all optionals and then move on to create a mock version of my current business's website https://www.ghosttrigger.com.
